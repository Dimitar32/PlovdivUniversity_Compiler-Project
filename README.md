# **Compiler Project**  
Course Project for Discipline - Translation Methods - 4th Year, 1st Semester

---

## **Project Description**  
This project was created as part of the coursework for Plovdiv University. It showcases the application of concepts learned in Translation Methods.

This is a **Compiler Project**, developed as part of the coursework for Translation Methods at Plovdiv University. The compiler takes basic C code as input and translates it into an intermediate representation or machine code.

- **Purpose:** To understand the fundamental concepts of compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

This project includes the following features:  
- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the input C code.  
- **Syntax Analysis:** Parses the tokens using a grammar to create a parse tree.  
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** Converts the parse tree into intermediate code.  
- **Error Handling:** Detects syntax and semantic errors.
